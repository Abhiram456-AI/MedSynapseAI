#  MedSynapseAI  
**An AI-Powered Clinical Trial Optimization Platform for Neurology and Oncology**


## Overview

**MedSynapseAI** is an intelligent analytics platform developed for the GE Healthcare Hackathon - Precision Care Challenge 2025. It aims to improve the efficiency and success rate of clinical trials in **Neurology and Oncology** using advanced Machine Learning and NLP techniques.

The platform focuses on:
- AI-based patient-trial matching
- Predictive analytics for dropout and adverse events
- Real-time trial monitoring
- Auto-generated clinical summaries using LLMs

---

## Problem Statement

Clinical trials in Neurology and Oncology often suffer from high dropout rates, inefficient patient-trial matching, and delayed protocol adaptation. These factors lead to extended timelines, increased costs, and lower trial efficacy.
